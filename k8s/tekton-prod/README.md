# tekton-prod
This is a similar configuration to `tekton-pipelines` but made for production deployments.

It will:
- Create a webhook to listen to GitHub release publish events
- Apply the latest full release after validating syntax (only validation for pre-release and drafts)

It assumes:
- You include a fully rendered kustomize in each of your releases named `prod-release-${version}.yaml`, with `${version}` being the tag and version of your release. 

This means that you can either make manual releases via publishing GitHub releases and including the rendered kustomize file or automatically release via the `components/pipelines-for-prod` struct. 

##Â usage

Overlay as follows, replacing the values with your own:
